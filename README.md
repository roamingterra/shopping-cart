# Shopping Cart

This is my third react application. It is a fake e-commerce, single page web application, that sells language software. The main functionality to be implemented in this project is a shopping cart that a user can add items to, and remove items from it. The user can choose the quantity desired of each shopping cart item. At the top of the shopping cart, the total number of items selected is shown. At the bottom of the shopping cart, the total price from all of the selected items is shown as well.

The goals of this project were to;

- Create a beautiful interface (responsive and visible across all devices)
- Include a home page and a shopping page
- Set up up routing so that the user can navigate between the pages
- Use the React testing library to develop using Test Driven Development
